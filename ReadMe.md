# Open VINS


Welcome to the Open VINS project!
The Open VINS project houses some core computer vision code along with a state-of-the art filter-based visual-inertial estimator.
The core filter is an [Extended Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) which fuses inertial information with sparse visual feature tracks.
These visual feature tracks are fused leveraging the [Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter (MSCKF)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4209642) sliding window formulation which allows for 3D features to update the state estimate without directly estimating the feature states in the filter.
Inspired by graph-based optimization systems, the included filter has modularity allowing for convenient covariance management with a proper type-based state system.
Please take a look at the feature list below for full details on what the system supports.
